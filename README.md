# prompt-engineering-exercise

This repository is tied to [Sabrina Goldfarb's prompt engineering exercise found on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/prompt-engineering/). Prompts were taken directly from her [course outline](https://sgoldfarb2.github.io/practical-prompt-engineering/lessons/core-prompting-techniques/standard-prompt).

In order to easily track and compare the outputs of the prompts, I've created branches associated with each prompt. The `main` branch contains commits associated with each prompt.

## Screenshots with associated prompts
